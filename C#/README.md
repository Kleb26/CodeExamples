#Example compiled version of VR Miscrope Visualisation Project.

A compiled, executable, example of a real microscope data set visualised in VR can be seen following this link:
<https://1drv.ms/u/s!AogGwILDvkA6gpkz0VyC6iL_TBsCJQ?e=x6nxwT>

Running the program requires SteamVR, more details in the README. 

The data set used is third party data of a Zebra fish heart beating captured on a thrid party SPIM device. The data is given
for example purposes to show off the VR visualisation program and rights to the original data remain with the third party.
